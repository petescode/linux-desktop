# Linux Desktop
For code that automates tasks for the Linux Desktop - primarily Fedora GNOME.
Initial setup, repo management, package installation, data backups, etc.
## fedora31-post-install.sh
A post-install bash script that sets up my desired repositories and installs packages. Arrays are available for easily adding or removing packages to be modified.
The script writes log messages to $logfile for review once it's complete.
I still need to add my GNOME custom modifications if possible - however it's in a working state for repo and package setup.
